Last updated: 2026-07-09

A full-stack logistics platform that enables shippers to post freight loads, carriers to bid on shipments, and customers to track deliveries in real time.

This project is being developed as a **4-week engineering project** following an incremental development approach with clear Git commits after every milestone.
